/*
CHALLENGE:
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

function evenOrOdd(number) {
  
}
*/

/*
ANSWER:
I did not remember which function could be used to evaluate a number as even/odd, thus I referenced JS operator documentation.
Could not find anything specific to even/odd evaluation, thus the division operator seemed to be the only option.
I first attempted to use '/' to divide by 2 however I then realized that I would still need to evaluate if there is a remainder or not.
There did not seem to be a function that could accomplish this directly.
After some reading, I saw that by rounding the product I could then determine if the rounded product is equal to the original product, and thus even.

function evenOrOdd(number) {
  if (Math.floor(number / 2) === (number / 2)) {
    return "Even";
  }
  else {
    return "Odd"
  }
}
