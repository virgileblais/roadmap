/*
CHALLENGE:
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

ANSWER:

function basicOp(operation, value1, value2) {
    if (operation == '+') {
     return (value1) + (value2); 
    }
    if (operation == '-') {
     return (value1) - (value2); 
    }
    if (operation == '*') {
     return (value1) * (value2); 
    }
    if (operation == '/') {
     return (value1) / (value2); 
    }
  }

//ANSWER is CORRECT

/*
REVISED ANSWER:
Upon reviewing peer answers, I saw switch case statements used and I thought that I could have used that instead of the lengthier 'if' statments.
*/

function basicOp(operation, value1, value2) {
    switch (operation) {
        case '+':
            return value1 + value2; 
        case '-':
            return value1 - value2; 
        case '*':
        value1 * value2; 
        case '/':
            return value1 / value2; 
    }
}
// q: how can i make the revised code even better?
