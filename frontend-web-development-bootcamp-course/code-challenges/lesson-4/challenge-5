What does result evaluate to?

const myObj = {
  nestedObject1: {
    price: 100,
    quantity: 5
  },
  nestedObject2: {
    price: 150,
    quantity: 2
  }
};

const myArray = [myObj.nestedObject1, myObj.nestedObject2];

const result = (myArray[0].price * myArray[0].quantity) > (myArray[1].price * myArray[1].quantity);
*/

/*
ANSWER:
result evaluates to true as:
    myArray[0].price (which is 100) multiplied by myArray[0].quantity (which is 5) evaluates to 500
    myArray[1].price (which is 150) multiplied by myArray[1].quantity (which is 2) evaluates to 300
    500 is greater than 300 thus result is true
