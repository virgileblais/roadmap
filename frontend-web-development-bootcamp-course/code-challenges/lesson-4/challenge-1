CHALLENGE:
Why doesn't this code work? Try to make it work and guess what the result will be (hint: this is a little bit of a review from last lesson).

const numberVariable = 0;

numberVariable++;
numberVariable++;
numberVariable++;

console.log(numberVariable);
*/

/*
ANSWER:
'const' was used to declare numberVariable thus numberVariable cannot be reassigned by numberVariable++. 'let' should have been used instead of const, as it allows for a variable to be reassigned
*/

let numberVariable = 0;

numberVariable++;
numberVariable++;
numberVariable++;

console.log(numberVariable); //3

// ANSWER CORRECT
