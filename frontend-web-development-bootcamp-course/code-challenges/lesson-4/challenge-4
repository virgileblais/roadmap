/*
CHALLENGE:
What does result evaluate to? You might want to review the previous lesson for this one.

const myObj = {
  prop1: 'first value',
  prop2: 20
};

// Index         0   1   2
const myArray = [40, 50, 2];

const result = myObj.prop2 === (myArray[0] / myArray[2]);
*/

/*
ANSWER:
Result evaluates to true as:
    myArray[0] (which is 40) divided by myArray[2] (which is 2) equals 20
    myObj.prop2 (which is 20) equals 20 in both value and type
*/

// ANSWER IS CORRECT
