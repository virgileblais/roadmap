CHALLENGE:
Do the following two blocks of code result in the same answer? If not, which one would you recommend using and why?

const firstNumber = 20;
const secondNumber = '20';

const result = firstNumber === secondNumber;

console.log(result);
const firstNumber = 20;
const secondNumber = '20';

const result = firstNumber == secondNumber;

console.log(result);
*/

/*
ANSWER:
No, as the '==' operator in the first block compares the value of firstNumber with the value of secondNumber which are equal thus the block evalutes to true, while the second block's '===' operator also compares type of firstNumber and secondNumber which are not equal thus the block evalutes to false.
I recommend using the second block of code, thus the '===' operator, as it will be more specific in comparison thus avoiding coercing the values to a common type which could result in unexpected results.
