/*
CHALLENGE:
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

function makeNegative(num) {
  // Code?
}
*/

/*
ANSWER:


function makeNegative(num) {
    (-(num));
  } 
*/

//ANSWER is INCORRECT

/*
REVISED ANSWER:
The function failed to pass the Code Wars test as it was not returning a value to evaluate via the test. I thus added a 'return' statement.
*/

function makeNegative(num) {
    return (-(num));
  }

//ANSWER is CORRECT
