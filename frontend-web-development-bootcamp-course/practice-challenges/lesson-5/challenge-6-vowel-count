Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

function getCount(str) {
  return 0;
}

/*
ANSWER:
As this problem seemed similar to challenge 5-counting sheep, I decided to follow the same approach with 'split' and 'filter'.
However in this challenge, I needed to filter 5 values instead of just 1, thus I used multiple '||' operators also.

function getCount(str) {
    count = str.split('').filter(character =>
        character === 'a' || character === 'e' || character === 'i' || character === 'o' || character === 'u').length;
    return count;
  }

//ANSWER is CORRECT
