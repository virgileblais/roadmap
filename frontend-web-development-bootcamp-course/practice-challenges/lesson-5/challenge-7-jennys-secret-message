CHALLENGE:
Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

function greet(name){
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
  if(name === "Johnny")
    return "Hello, my love!";
}
*/

/*
ANSWER:
The 2 statements within the function were out of order as the first statement would be returned before the second, thus even if the input name was 'Johnny', the output would be 'Hello, Johnny!' 

function greet(name){
    if (name === "Johnny")
      return "Hello, my love!";
    else return "Hello, " + name + "!";
  }
*/

//ANSWER is CORRECT

/*
REVISED ANSWER:
Upon review, I realized that the 'else' in the 2nd statement was redudant because if the 'if' statement was not met, then the remainder of the function would be executed, thus an 'else' statement would be redundant.

function greet(name){
    if (name === "Johnny")
      return "Hello, my love!";
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
  }
